-App has two parts, client and server
-we are using vite
-Setting up client 
    -npm create vite@latest client 
    -choose react and js
    -cd client and npm install
    -install tailwind with vite (check website for tailwind plus vite)
-pushing to github

-creating routes
    -first, we will have to create the pages for routes
    -we create a folder in src, called pages and than create the pages we need.
    -we download the react router using the command "npm i react-router-dom" inside the client section
    -we always set up the router inside the appjs, so we import BrowserRouter, Routes and Route in the app.jsx 
    -we then wrap everything as below
        -<BrowserRouter>
        -<Routes>
        -    <Route path = "/" element = {<Home />} />
        -</Routes>
        -</BrowserRouter>
