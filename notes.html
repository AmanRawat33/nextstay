-App has two parts, client and server
-we are using vite
-Setting up client 
    -npm create vite@latest client 
    -choose react and js
    -cd client and npm install
    -install tailwind with vite (check website for tailwind plus vite)
-pushing to github

-creating routes
    -first, we will have to create the pages for routes
    -we create a folder in src, called pages and than create the pages we need.
    -we download the react router using the command "npm i react-router-dom" inside the client section
    -we always set up the router inside the appjs, so we import BrowserRouter, Routes and Route in the app.jsx 
    -we then wrap everything as below
        -<BrowserRouter>
        -<Routes>
        -    <Route path = "/" element = {<Home />} />
        -</Routes>
        -</BrowserRouter>

-creating header component
    -we create a folder component in the src and than create the header component
    -we see that the header component is present in all the pages so we directly put it in the app.jsx
    outside the routes and below the BrowserRouter.
    -we than create the header component using the <header></header> for SEO purposes.
    -this has three sections, h1, form for search bar, and the menu. 
    -for the menu buttons to redirect to different pages, we use the <Link> from "react-router-dom"
    -we wrap each button inside the link and in the link we add to for the routing. 

-create and run the server
    -we run npm init to create a package.json in the root folder. 
    -we create api folder just like the client folder.
    -we install express in the root folder.
    -we add the "type" "module" to enable named imports in the index.js file 
    -we import express in the index.js file and initialize the app = express()
    -we than listen on the app,
        app.listen(3000, ()=> {});
    -we then install nodemon for refreshing the server automatically.
    -we add the scripts in the index.js in api for our convenience.

-connect to database
    -create an account on the mongodb website.
    -choose the free tier option. 
    -select a name for the project, and save the details
    -then copy the link from the website for the project 
    -install dotenv for mongoose.connect(MONGO) in the index.js 
    -create a .env file and paste the the link as a string in the variable called MONGO 
    -then in the index.js, import the dotenv and initialize it using dotenv.config() and use it for the mongoose.connect(MONGO) and use .then and .catch to see
    if the connection to mongodb is successfull or not.

-create user model 
    -create a folder called "models" inside api 
    -create user.model.js inside models or just user.js 
    -import mongoose from "mongoose" and then create a schema and then a model 
    -for creating a schema 
        -const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({username: {type: String, required: true, unique: true}, etc}, {timestamps: true});
        -timestamps: true helps in saving the time of the creation/updating the user. 
    -for creating a user model 
        -const User = new mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
        -then export the model using default export 
        -"User" should be uppercase and singular 

-create a test API route 
    -create routes folder inside the api folder 
    -set up a test route named user.route.js 
    -import express from "express" 
    -const router = express.Router();
    -we need to create another folder inside api, called controllers to write the logic of the function
    as it will make the code look cleaner and will be easier to maintain. 
    -we need to add .js in the import in index.js and routes otherwise it will give an error 
    -in the index.js we update the function app.use("/api/user/", userRouter)

-create a middleware and a function to handle possible errors 
    -in the index.js page, we set up another 
        -app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
            const statusCode = err.statusCode;
            const message = err.message;
            return res.status(statusCode).json({
                success: false,
                statusCode,
                message,
            })
        })
    -then we go to the auth.controller.js to also take next as an input and then in the catch block,
    we use the next(error);
    -then we create utils folder inside the api folder. And inside it, we create error.js for handling the errors.
    -we create errorHandler function that accepts (statusCode, error) and create a new error using the 
    js error creator and at the last of this function throw/return this error.
