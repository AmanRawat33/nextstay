-App has two parts, client and server
-we are using vite
-Setting up client 
    -npm create vite@latest client 
    -choose react and js
    -cd client and npm install
    -install tailwind with vite (check website for tailwind plus vite)
-pushing to github

-creating routes
    -first, we will have to create the pages for routes
    -we create a folder in src, called pages and than create the pages we need.
    -we download the react router using the command "npm i react-router-dom" inside the client section
    -we always set up the router inside the appjs, so we import BrowserRouter, Routes and Route in the app.jsx 
    -we then wrap everything as below
        -<BrowserRouter>
        -<Routes>
        -    <Route path = "/" element = {<Home />} />
        -</Routes>
        -</BrowserRouter>

-creating header component
    -we create a folder component in the src and than create the header component
    -we see that the header component is present in all the pages so we directly put it in the app.jsx
    outside the routes and below the BrowserRouter.
    -we than create the header component using the <header></header> for SEO purposes.
    -this has three sections, h1, form for search bar, and the menu. 
    -for the menu buttons to redirect to different pages, we use the <Link> from "react-router-dom"
    -we wrap each button inside the link and in the link we add to for the routing. 

-create and run the server
    -we run npm init to create a package.json in the root folder. 
    -we create api folder just like the client folder.
    -we install express in the root folder.
    -we add the "type" "module" to enable named imports in the index.js file 
    -we import express in the index.js file and initialize the app = express()
    -we than listen on the app,
        app.listen(3000, ()=> {});
    -we then install nodemon for refreshing the server automatically.
    -we add the scripts in the index.js in api for our convenience.

-connect to database
    -create an account on the mongodb website.
    -choose the free tier option. 
    -select a name for the project, and save the details
    -then copy the link from the website for the project 
    -install dotenv for mongoose.connect(MONGO) in the index.js 
    -create a .env file and paste the the link as a string in the variable called MONGO 
    -then in the index.js, import the dotenv and use it for the mongoose.connect(MONGO) and use .then and .catch to see
    if the connection to mongodb is successfull or not.
